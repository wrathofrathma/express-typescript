# Express Typescript Template
Since there is no default project scaffold for express with typescript, I'm going to build one with the features I want.

# Features
- [x] Express.js
- [x] Typescript
- [x] Hot reloading development environment
- [x] Global configuration files parsed before startup
- [x] .env parsing into configuration before startup
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Database migrations
